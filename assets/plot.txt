Oof my head hurts, where am I?  Why am I covered in all these bumps...  What's going on?  I need to find some medicine
Oh goodness.... that was not good... At least I can jump higher now... I think....
How am I supposed to get up there now?  Ugh these bumps itch... I need to keep looking for a cure.
That one is absolutely not the cure... At least I'm faster now I guess...
Another floor?  How long can this place go on?  I need to get to help soon.
I feel fuzzy.... But I think I can jump off walls now so that's cool.
Hopefully this is the last one, I need to get out of here soon.
I'm going to puke... This is the worst one yet...  I feel like I can't jump as high but I can float forever now...
