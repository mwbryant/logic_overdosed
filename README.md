# Logic Overdosed

This is a personal game project created with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) for the [Bevy Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3).

A platformer where you constantly take medicine hoping it will cure your illness but the side effects might not be worth the benefits.

Control with WASD and Space, 4 levels.

All Art and Audio created by LogicProjects during the jam period.  All core gameplay code also written during the jam period but simple art effects like sprite sheet animation and fade effects were taken from older projects.
